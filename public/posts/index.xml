            <description>MacBook Pro 13 without TouchBar   My good friend wants to kill his MacBook He&amp;rsquo;s already had it, the one in the picture above, for a couple of years, and the battery is starting to degrade. He has a decent budget for a new computer, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a new laptop until this one stops functioning.
We are going to destroy the MacBook by heat over the next few weeks.</description>

<p>He&rsquo;s already had it, the one in the picture above, for a couple of years, and the battery is starting to degrade. He has a decent budget for a new computer, but doesn&rsquo;t want to buy a new laptop until this one stops functioning.</p>
<p>We are going to destroy the MacBook by <strong>heat</strong> over the next few weeks. MacBooks are known for their subpar cooling systems. Instead of wasting this Mac&rsquo;s <strong>insane</strong> computational power, we are going to set it up for mining <a href="https://www.getmonero.org/">Monero(XMR)</a>, a type of cryptocurrency that can be mined with a CPU. He is only going to earn a couple pennies per day, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing. I don&rsquo;t know how he&rsquo;ll be able to sleep through the insane fan noise. Maybe he&rsquo;ll have to run an extension cable to his closet.</p>

<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>You have been warned that there are risks such as damage to the computer keeping it at a high temperature for long periods of time.</p>
<p>It is barely profitable to do this on a laptop.</p>
<p>Pools usually have a minimum of 0.1 XMR payout, so it would take atleast a couple of months to be able to withdraw Monero if using a laptop.</p>
<p>Please do this at your own risk.</p>
<h2 id="installing-xmrig">Installing xmrig</h2>
<p>Install Xcode from the App Store:</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Open the terminal application on your mac and copy and paste the code below into it, step by step.</strong></em></p>
<p>Install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS:</p>
<p><code>/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)&quot;</code></p>
<p>Install the required dependencies with Homebrew:</p>
<p><code>brew install git cmake libuv libmicrohttpd openssl hwloc</code></p>
<p>Clone, or in other words, save the xmrig mining software with git:</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git</code></p>
<p>Make the build directory inside of the xmrig directory:</p>
<p><code>mkdir xmrig/build</code></p>
<p>Navigate into the build directory inside xmrig</p>
<p><code>cd xmrig/build</code></p>
<p>Build the program with cmake, then make:</p>
<p><code>cmake .. -DOPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=/usr/local/opt/openssl</code></p>
<p><code>make -j$(sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu)</code></p>
<h2 id="generating-the-xmrig-config-code">Generating the xmrig config code</h2>
<p>The people over at xmrig made a wonderful configuration wizard which helps create a line of code to start the miner.</p>
<p>Open the <a href="https://xmrig.com/wizard">xmrig configuration wizard</a></p>
<p>Click the <strong>New configuration</strong> button.</p>
<p>Press on the <strong>Add pool</strong> button.</p>
<p>Click on your pool of choice in the dropdown. I use the supporxmr.com pool.</p>
<p>Then there will be a popup where it asks for the <strong>Monero wallet address</strong>, where you type in your wallet. You can also choose to set a <strong>Worker name</strong>, something like MacBookPro13.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <strong>Backends</strong> tab and only turn on the <strong>CPU</strong> option. You can use a GPU if you have one, but I don&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>
<p>Next, select the <strong>Misc</strong> tab and set a donation percentage, I chose to leave the <strong>HTTP API</strong> option off.</p>
<p>Finally, navigate the the <strong>Result</strong> tab, click on macOS option under the <strong>Command line</strong>. Copy the line of code.</p>
<h2 id="making-an-executable-shell-script">Making an executable shell script</h2>
<p>While this is not a required step, I recommend that you do it for ease of use.</p>
<p>Go back to the terminal app.</p>
<p>If it is still open, navigate to the user(<strong>~</strong>) directory:</p>
<p><code>cd .. &amp;&amp; cd ..</code></p>
<p>If you reopened it, double check that you are in the <strong>~</strong> directory.</p>
<p>Create a shell script called xmr:</p>
<p><code>touch xmr.sh</code></p>
<p>Make it executable</p>
<p><code>chmod +x xmr.sh</code></p>
<p>Edit the shell script to make it navigate to the xmrig/build directory, and start the miner from there:</p>
<p><code>nano xmr.sh</code></p>
<p>A basic text editor will show up.</p>
<p>Type the following into it, each on a separate line:</p>
<p><code>cd xmrig/build</code></p>
<p><code>copy and paste the code that we generated earlier from the configurator</code></p>
<p>Press control x and then press enter to save the edits made to the file.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-shell-script">Running the shell script</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually really easy, type the following into terminal from the <strong>~</strong> directory, which is the default when you open Terminal:</p>
<p><code>./xmr.sh</code></p>
<p>To stop the program press control c.</p>
<p>You can monitor all sorts of statistics on the pool&rsquo;s home page, logging in with your wallet address as your username.</p>
<h2 id="updating-xmrig">Updating xmrig</h2>
<p>Navigate to the build directory:</p>
<p><code>cd xmrig/build</code></p>
<p>Update using the git pull command:</p>
<p><code>git pull</code></p>

            <description>Hello World!
Why did I make this website and what even is it? I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked although you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t! I made and will continue to make this website because I want to learn how to build a website. I also enjoy writing, especially when it isn&amp;rsquo;t tied to a grade.
I will be posting about everything from a small cryptocurrency mining operation that I run in the basement to my favorite hobby of RC flight to my own ice cream recipes and everything in between.</description>

<p>I&rsquo;m glad you asked although you probably didn&rsquo;t! I made and <strong>will continue</strong> to make this website because I want to learn how to build a website. I also enjoy writing, especially when it isn&rsquo;t tied to a grade.</p>
<p>I will be posting about everything from a small cryptocurrency mining operation that I run in the basement to my favorite hobby of RC flight to my own ice cream recipes and everything in between. In short, the things that I do to keep myself sane, especially during quarantine. I&rsquo;ll post at least every week. This is my blog site.</p>
