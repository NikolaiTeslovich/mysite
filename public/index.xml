      <description>Here are some pictures of my friends over at @teamsketchyfpv flying some of their planes.
Thanks to them for inviting me, I had an absolute blast.
Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s time for me to get an RC jet!
And yes, we did keep at least six feet apart.

      <description>Enjoy this video, I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of how it turned out!
  I finally convinced my best friend to lend me his drone after days of trying.
I actually have a drone, an EMAX Tinyhawk 2, which note to self I still need to fix. I crashed it pretty hard flying on the porch of my house against a metal support beam and one of the ESC&amp;rsquo;s is burned out.</description>

      <description>I recently went on a camping/cabining trip with my family around New England, especially Maine.
I know there are a lot of photographs, but I really like all of these.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted anything on social media, with YouTube being the only exception. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t even go as far as to call it social media. In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s almost been three years since I posted anything on my personal instagram account @nikolaiteslovich.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I stopped. I guess it just happened.
These times are now gone, with the commencement of a new Instagram account: @projectniknek which you should totally follow by the way.</description>

      <description>This was a project for my speech and debate class, the sources are in the video&amp;rsquo;s description.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the video version of the speech:
  Here&amp;rsquo;s the transcript of the speech:
What do you think of when you hear the word “Bitcoin”? According to a 2017 YouGov survey, 62% of Americans believe that cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are used for illegal purchases or don’t know what they’re used for at all.</description>

      <description>Note that this is not a build guide of the car itself. Rather, how to integrate the 3D printed parts with the plane parts for your own projects.
Printing the parts The parts can be found in the plans GitHub repo.
I recommend printing the All_parts_arranged.stl
I used an Ultimaker 3 to print the parts with eSun PLA+ at a 0.2mm layer height at 215C, 35% infill, along with a PETG brim for easy cleanup.</description>

      <description>I walked around the garden and garage to see what pictures I could make. Here are the ones that I liked:

      <title>Vacuum Tube Amplifier</title>

      <description>Last night, I was listening to music on a vacuum tube amplifier that I assembled a while back from a kit.
I really liked the look of the tubes in dark, they had a very retro aesthetic. Since they glowed in a very gentle orange-red color, they were perfect for a long exposure.
Maybe it has to do with the look of these tubes, but I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that music sounds better on tubes than on a transistor amp.</description>

      <description>Today, I headed down to The Arboretum at Penn State to see what flowers and insects were in store for me.
At first, I decided to bring a 35mm macro lens. However, after seeing all of the dragonflies and lilies, I biked home in record time and snagged a telephoto lens.
I present to you the Water lilies and Dragonflies at The Arboretum at Penn State.
