      <description>MacBook Pro 13 without TouchBar   My good friend wants to kill his MacBook He&amp;rsquo;s already had it, the one in the picture above, for a couple of years, and the battery is starting to degrade. He has a decent budget for a new computer, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a new laptop until this one stops functioning.
We are going to destroy the MacBook by heat over the next few weeks.</description>

      <description>Hello World!
Why did I make this website and what even is it? I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked although you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t! I made and will continue to make this website because I want to learn how to build a website. I also enjoy writing, especially when it isn&amp;rsquo;t tied to a grade.
I will be posting about everything from a small cryptocurrency mining operation that I run in the basement to my favorite hobby of RC flight to my own ice cream recipes and everything in between.</description>
