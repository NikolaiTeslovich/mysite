      <description>MacBook Pro 13 without TouchBar   My good friend wants to kill his MacBook He&amp;rsquo;s already had it, the one in the picture above, for a couple of years, and the battery is starting to degrade. He has a decent budget for a new computer, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to buy a new laptop until this one stops functioning.
We are going to destroy the MacBook by heat over the next few weeks.</description>
