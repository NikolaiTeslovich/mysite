## Hi! Nice to meet you.

My name is Nikolai Nekrutenko and I live in State College, Pennsylvania. I am a rising senior at State College Area High School.

My first language is Russian. This is because my parents come from Kiev, the capital of Ukraine (when they were born it was still part of the Soviet Union). I could not speak any English until I went to daycare. My parents told me that I tried to teach everyone Russian instead of learning English. I just thought it would be easier! Eventually, I gave up and learned English from the children around me. Later on, I took French lessons until I eventually took it at school. I am now proficient in French too.

I enjoy playing tennis and badminton with my friends or mom. My dad and I like to go mountain and fat biking on challenging trails such as those by Raystown Lake. Also, I take part in a sport which I have been practicing for over nine years. It is Tang Soo Do, a Korean martial art. I currently hold the rank of black belt candidate.

My favorite hobby is model aviation. I fly planes any chance I get, and when they crash, build new ones. I built a homemade Arduino-based CNC cutter. I might even get around to writing a post about it. The CNC allows me to quickly cut out new planes. The planes I fly do not last for very long anyway, on the order of a few weeks. This passion for aviation prompted me to start an [aeronautics club](https://nikolaiteslovich.github.io/shmac/) at my high school.

Over the course of the pandemic, I have been indulging myself with more and more hobbies and projects. Particularly photography, drones, microcontrollers, electronics, programming in Python, and—how could I forget—this website. **This is what this website is about, my hobbies!**
