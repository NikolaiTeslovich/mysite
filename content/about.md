## Hi! Nice to meet you.

I'm Nikolai—a **well-rounded individual** with an **appreciation for nature** who is an **aspiring engineer—a tinkerer at heart**.

I enjoy spending time in the untouched wilderness with a [camera at my side](/gallery).

I also find satisfaction in building, flying, and ultimately crashing RC aircraft and drones. This passion for aviation prompted me to start an [aeronautics club](https://shmac.netlify.app/) at my high school.

Some of my other passions include, in no particular order, photography, content creation, drones, cryptocurrencies, electonics, programming, martial arts, languages, playing the guitar, and of course this website.
