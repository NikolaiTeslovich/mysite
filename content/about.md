## Hi! Nice to meet you.

My name is Nikolai Nekrutenko. I pride myself on being an individual with many interests, which is **exactly** what this website is about! and I am a non-degree student at Penn State University, since I graduated high school early.

My favorite hobby is model aviation. I fly planes any chance I get, and when they crash, build new ones. I built a [homemade Arduino-based CNC cutter](https://nikolaiteslovich.github.io/shmac/posts/2020/01/flite-test-tiny-trainer-kits/). The CNC allows me to quickly cut out new planes for myself and my club. The planes I fly do not last for very long anyway, on the order of a few weeks. This passion for aviation prompted me to start an [aeronautics club](https://nikolaiteslovich.github.io/shmac/) at my high school.

Over the course of the pandemic, I have been indulging myself with more and more hobbies and projects. Particularly in no particular order: photography, drones, cryptocurrencies, microcontrollers, electronics, programming in Python, and—how could I forget—this website. **This is what this website is about, my hobbies!**
