Today, I headed down to [The Arboretum at Penn State](https://arboretum.psu.edu/) to see what flowers and insects were in store for me.

At first, I decided to bring a 35mm macro lens. However, after seeing all of the dragonflies and lilies, I biked home in record time and snagged a telephoto lens.

I present to you the Water lilies and Dragonflies at The Arboretum at Penn State.
