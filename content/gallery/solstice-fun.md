I went camping with my family in the beautiful Northern PA countryside, near the finger lakes.

To celebrate the longest day of the year, I found a stick about my height and lit both ends of it on **fire**. It was similar to the staff that I use in Tang Soo Do, so I messed around with various techniques. Particularly, I really enjoy doing the figure-eight technique where you essentially spin the stick in the shape of an infinity sign.

So, I mounted my camera with an ultra wide lens on a tripod and did several long exposure photographs. The shutter was open for ~ 20 to ~ 30 seconds.

**In hindsight, this was certainly not a safe thing to do!**

I wrote a program in python that helps displaying the images about by generating a table in markdown, which is the format that I use to code this website. **The images are clickable!**

Here's the program if you wanna take a look:

Please note that I have not fully finished commenting and organizing the code.
