I've had **enough sitting at home**, not leaving my neighborhood for a week. So, I ventured out to *Jo Hays Vista* with my newly built FPV freestyle drone and camera at my side.

Unfortunately I forgot to charge the FPV goggles before hand, so the drone was practically useless. I'm still glad I saw the harsh, wind-chiseled ice.
