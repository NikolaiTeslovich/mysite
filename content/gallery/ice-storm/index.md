A massive ice storm just passed by State College. So while most people were scared of slipping and breaking an arm, I decided to venture out into the neighborhood and nearby golf course with my macro 35mm lens.

I find the texture of the ice fascinatingâ€”it resembles a network of plant cells, or looks like some carbonated drink.
