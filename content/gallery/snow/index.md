**Happy New Year!**

A major snowstorm recently unleashed its wrath on us, for a grand total of *14in* or *35cm* of fluffly, dry snow!

Here are some of my favorite long exposures from the evening.

Yes, you did notice something slightly different about this gallery. Actually, I probably already converted all of my existing galleries by now, so whatever.

I'm using a [new system](https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery) to generate these galleries. No longer do I have to deal with endless markdown tables!
