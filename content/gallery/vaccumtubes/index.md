Last night, I was listening to music on a vacuum tube amplifier that I assembled a while back from a kit.

I really liked the look of the tubes in dark, they had a very retro aesthetic. Since they glowed in a very gentle orange-red color, they were perfect for a long exposure.

Maybe it has to do with the look of these tubes, but I'm convinced that **music sounds better on tubes** than on a transistor amp.
