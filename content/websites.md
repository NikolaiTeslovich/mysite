So far, I have built [*documentation websites*](https://cryptoclarified.netlify.app/docs/minerwrangler/), [*organization websites*](https://shmac.netlify.app/), and [*personal websites*](/) integrated with a [*photo gallery*](/gallery).

## If you would like a website

1. Pick a [Hugo theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/)
2. Test it on both mobile and desktop to make sure that you like it
3. Please send me an email at nekrutnikolai@gmail.com
4. Enjoy your gorgeous website in a matter of days

## Payment options

You almost thought I was going to build it for free, didn't you?

## Why you should choose me

I will **always** do **my best** and **pour my soul** into building your next website, whatever it may be.
Put simply, I enjoy tinkering with code and **enjoy** making websites **aesthetically pleasing**. As I said in the previous section, if you do not enjoy your website, I will try my best until you do.

If you still have doubts, check out my [CV](/cv) and [GitHub](https://github.com/NikolaiTeslovich) to see my accomplishments and projects.

## Websites that I refuse to build

- E-commerce stores
  - However, I will be glad to build a brand website
  - This may change once I learn more Javascript
