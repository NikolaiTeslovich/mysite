I know it's been **well over a month**.

I promised that I would post every week, so that promise is already broken.

## What did I think of online school?

Ever since the school resumed after spring break, it's all been online because of this COVID-19 situation. Although I didn't learn as much I didn't really mind as it was way easier and less stressful than regular school. The school that I go to implemented a pass-fail type of deal for the last marking period. Basically, if you got a 60% or above, you would get a 100%. If you were to get below a 60%, which I think is harder than getting above a 60%, your 4th marking period would be discounted. Keep in mind that assignments that you don't do are worth 50% no matter what. Teachers also held Zoom office hours twice a week, but who actually went to them after then first meeting? So yeah, it was basically a joke. I'm glad they did it that way, though.

## I'm really worried about this COVID-19 situation.

For several reasons, really. People are starting to deny facts, and have an extremely short attention span. It was a big deal in February, and at the start of spring. Now, it just seems like everyone's forgotten about it. Unfortunately, the number of cases keeps growing and growing because nobody is really shutting down anything. The entire thing could have been prevented if things were closed at the start of this pandemic. It's like an investment, the more money you put in at an earlier time, the more you will get out of it later. According to several sources, the vaccine will be ready best case scenario in winter.

## Planned projects

On a bit of a brighter note, I have several projects planned for this summer. I want to build and fly 5" quadcopter, like in the image above to get some beautiful cinematic footage similar to the video shown below, although it'll definitely take some time to reach Le Drib's level of smoothness.

I also plan on designing and building tons of planes, and spending a lot of time flying them and the quadcopter. Hopefully, everyday.
