Hello World!

### Why did I make this website and what even is it?

I'm glad you asked although you probably didn't! I made and **will continue** to make this website because I want to learn how to build a website. I also enjoy writing, especially when it isn't tied to a grade.

I will be posting about everything from a small cryptocurrency mining operation that I run in the basement to my favorite hobby of RC flight to my own ice cream recipes and everything in between. In short, the things that I do to keep myself sane, especially during quarantine. I'll post at least every week. This is my blog site.
